        <h2>Motivation for success - how to motivate yourself to <br>
          successfully achieve goals in life</h2>
        <p>
       Why is it important to set your own goals? Because otherwise, there is a high probability<br>
       of being led by other people's aspirations. Often people do not notice that they are following<br>
       the guidelines of their parents, friends, colleagues. You need a car, an apartment, a family and<br>
       children, but who? If there is a desire to go on a journey, record a song, create a business, then<br>
       it is necessary to draw up an implementation plan in these areas. Meeting common expectations is not<br>
       the right decision.<br>
       To achieve success is too vague a figurative goal. You need to be very clear about what exactly needs<br>
       to be achieved. And, of course, understand that the tasks must be real. Of course, “to become the head<br>
       of Gazprom”, “to head Bank of America” are excellent aspirations. But with a probability of 100% they <br>
       will remain dreams. Desires must be compared with real possibilities, otherwise the inevitable series of<br>
       failures will lower self-esteem and discourage the craving for self-realization.<br>
       A great way to motivate yourself to succeed is to visualize in detail what it will be like. This is <br>
       necessary in order to be charged with positive emotions thanks to drawing in thoughts. It is they who<br>
        give a person satisfaction, stimulate him to move on, force him to influence his own subconscious mind.<br>
        Logic is inextricably linked with consciousness, and emotional intelligence is inextricably linked with<br>
        the psyche.<br>

    <h2>How to develop willpower</h2>
        <p>
          Willpower, at its core, is the ability to successfully cope with tasks. It is she who determines <br>
          how quickly you can get involved in work, give up junk food, start going to the gym. Willpower is<br> 
          applicable to absolutely all aspects of life.<br>
          Two ways to build willpower<br>
          Cultivate will. To strengthen muscles, we put them under stress, and they get tired, and when they<br>
          recover, they become stronger. Willpower is trained on the same principle: take hold of your health,<br>
          try to streamline your thoughts and become more focused.<br>
          Use power wisely. Willpower - especially. Sometimes it is better to go around the mountain than climb<br>
          it. Likewise, most everyday tasks actually require less effort than meets the eye.<br>
          With willpower, just like money: the less you spend, the more you end up with. It would be logical to<br>
           assume that you can make the environment work for you, that is, reduce the likelihood of situations <br>
           where you may need willpower. This means that you can calmly focus on the most important thing.<br></p>

    <h2>Affirmations for Inner Strength and Self-Esteem</h2>
        <p>
          <p>
            Energy is vibration. High vibrations refer to high feelings and emotions. This is happiness, inner<br>
            harmony and freedom, joy and pleasure of life, gratitude. When you raise your vibration, you are<br> 
            connecting to energies of high frequencies.<br>
            Especially the practice of increasing vibrations is significant during the Earth's quantum transition.<br>
            An increase in vibrations allows you to receive new and high-quality energies, attract more abundance<br>
            and harmonious events, and move to a new level of consciousness.<br>
            Practice with affirmations will help you on the path of self-development and opening up new opportunities.<br>
           <ul> Examples of affirmations:</ul>
           <li> All around is energy.</li>
           <li>I am part of the universe. I welcome positive and high vibrations in my space.</li>
          <li>  I am the source of sacred and pure energy.</li>
          <li> I am energy.</li>
          <li>My thoughts, words, deeds send high, blissful and healing energies into space.</li>
          <li>I also only accept the energies of love, harmony and light.</li>
          <li>My energy and vibrations are my strength and the way to reveal my inner potential.</li>
          <li>  With every word, thought and action, I raise my vibrations.</li></p><br>
